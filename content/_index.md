A monthly gathering of P≈çneke-based nerds who hack on systems which serve
society. We span art/ tech/ activism/ academia/ community organising etc.

**peer-4-peer** : _the name takes the idea of a
[peer-2-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network (which are
notoriously resilient and poly-centric), and shifts the focus from naming shape
of the
network, to the networked relationships of interdependance._
